# Automatic-like-giver-on-instgram
The code uses the selenium and pyautogui liabaries.

The program receives from the user the following as inputs:
- mail that is being used for facebook.
- facebook password .
- name of the person we want to give likes to.
- number of photos we want to give like starting from the latest one this iser has.

At the moment i am working on finding the xpath of the like button, due to instgram blocking automated control web drivers i involve most of the clicking with
the pyautogui libary so from the moment we log in to the account we locate the buttons by x,y cords.
